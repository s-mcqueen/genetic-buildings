genetic-buildings
=================

An independent research project in Artificial Intelligence. Attempting to create genetic algorithms that will evolve solutions to simple problems in architecture.

In the first section of the project, I researched genetic algorithms and built 'tsp.py' -- a program that evolves solutions to the classic NP-Complete Traveling Salesman Problem.

In the second section of the project, I plan to implement similar genetic techniques to solve more interesting problems. For instance, what is the optimal structure to build given specific physical and financial constraints?

Libraries used so far:
* pygame (to display the buildings)
* pymunk (physics engine -- will do heavy lifting for fitness function)
* shapely (to deal with polygon issues)

Work in progress...
